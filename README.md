### Links

- Github URL: [social-links-fem](https://github.com/Marvie-03/social-links-fem)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries


### What I learned

The mobile view wasn't responsive. I had to use media query.
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    footer{
        display: none;
    }
    .card{
        max-width: 20rem;
    }
}
```



### Continued development

I'll make a social link profile for myself
